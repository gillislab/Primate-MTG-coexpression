Scripts to reproduce cross-species coexpression analysis in the paper titled
"Conserved coexpression at single cell resolution across primate brains"

==============================================================================================

We generated a consensus taxonomy of MTG cell types across 5 primates and used this list of 57
shared cell types to explore the conservation and divergence of transcriptional patterning
across species. The main steps in this analysis includes:
    1. Generating pseudo-bulk data (14,131 genes x 57 cell types) from single nucleus RNA-seq
       datasets in each species
    2. Calculating expression profile similarity (expressolog scores) for orthologs across
       each species pair and at different cellular resolutions
    3. Constructing aggregate coexpression networks from single nucleus expression data
    4. Calculating the similarity of gene coexpression neighborhoods across species
    5. Validating the extent of gene functional conservation inferred from single cell data
       in large scale, meta-analytic bulk coexpression networks of 19 phylogenetically-
       diverse species across metazoa
