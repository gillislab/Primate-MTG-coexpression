coexp_cons_across_22_species.csv: coexpression conservation scores for 14,131 genes between
all pairs of 22 species
	
    coexpression conservation scores are calculated using meta-analytic aggregate networks
    generated from bulk transcriptomic data and accessed from CoCoCoNet. These scores can
    be accessed from https://labshare.cshl.edu/shares/gillislab/resource/Primate_MTG_coexp/

    list of species: human, chimp, rhesus macaque, crab-eating macaque, mouse, rat, rabbit,
    pig, cow, goat, sheep, horse, dog, chicken, zebrafish, salmon, trout, fruitfly, silkworm,
    bee, roundworm, yeast
	
	
cross_species_cluster_aggregated_new.txt: list of all within-species cluster and their corresponding
cross-species cluster mapping. Note that not all cross-species clusters contain clusters from all 5
primates, and only 57 cross-species clusters contain one or more clusters from each primate.


expressolog_scores_cell_hierarchy.csv: Expressolog score (expression profile similarity of orthologs
relative to other genes) at different levels of cellular organization

    Scores (AUROC) for 14,131 genes are calculated at different levels of cell type hierarchy to
    measure the extent of conserved cross-species coexpression at multiple scales

    Scores averaged over all primate pairs in columns 2-5 and averaged between human and
    non-human primates in columns 6-9


hgnc_syngo_geneset_scores.csv: Performance of HGNC and SynGO-curated gene sets in classifying 57
consensus cell types within and across primates

    Scores are calculated for gene sets with 5 or more genes, in each cell type both
    within and across primates

    Scores averaged over species and cell types are reported as 'within_species' and 'cross_species'
    mean AUROC; used to generate Fig 1G


human_nhp_cell_lineage_scores.csv: Expressolog score calculated across cell types at different levels
of cell hierarchy. Average of scores calculated between human and non-human primates are reported. 


human_sc_bulk_diverged_genes.csv: Genes with potential human-specific functional divergence
identified using single-cell and bulk transcriptomic data

    column 2: 1 if the gene is expressed in human and non-human primates

    column 3: FALSE if the gene has some expression variability across cell types in each of
    the three classes

    columns 4-6: 1 indicates gene has diverged expression profile betn. Human and NHP
    (expressolog score < 0.55) in excitatory, inhibitory and non-neurons respectively

    column 7: 1 if gene is diverged (expressolog score < 0.55) in at least one cell class

    column 8: p-values from one-sided Mann-Whitney test to check if coexpression conservation betn.
    human and non-human mammals	is lesser than that betn. non-human mammals 
    (p-values adjusted by Benjamini-Hochberg method)

    column 9: similar to column 8, but adjusted p-values measure difference betn. human and
    non-human mammals compared to vertebrates (chicken and zebrafish) with non-human mammals
	
	  column 10: 1 if gene has adj p-value < 0.05 both in column 8 and 9
	
	  column 11: genes categorized as 'Diverged_in_single-cell' if Div_in_atleast1class = 1;
    'Diverged_in_bulk' if Div_in_bulk = 1; 'Diverged_in_both' for 139 genes with concordant
    divergence in single-cell and bulk data


human_top_markers_table.csv: List of marker genes for cell classes, subclasses and cell types in the
human MTG transcriptomic data

	  Marker genes for 3 cell classes, 24 subclasses and 57 cell types are indicated by '1' in table below
	
	  Marker genes were selected using MetaMarkers package (200, 100, 50 genes for each cell class,
	  subclass and cell type respectively)


species_1-1_OrthoDb.csv: list of 14,131 human genes names and their 1-1 orthologs in the other 4 primates
