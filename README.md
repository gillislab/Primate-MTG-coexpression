Conserved coexpression at single cell resolution across primate brains

Many differences between closely related species are driven by alterations in transcriptional regulation which affect where genes are expressed and how genes work together. Determining how gene coexpression networks change across species is an essential step toward identifying novel regulatory relationships that underlie phenotypic variability. We use single cell expression data from the middle temporal gyrus of five primates (human, chimp, gorilla, macaque and marmoset) to identify marker gene sets that robustly distinguish 57 homologous cell types, and calculate the similarity of gene coexpression networks across matched cell types.
